欢迎来此，我的研究兴趣是水文模型构建和生态水文相关研究。近期的主要研究是全球水文模型构建、CO₂-植被-径流过程及其不确定性分析。开发了SRS模型率定算法。目前在做全球AWRA模型的相关开发工作。

Welcome to my personal homepage. My research interests lie in the construction of hydrological models and ecohydrology-related studies. Recently, I have been focusing on the development of global hydrological models, the CO₂-vegetation-runoff processes, and the uncertainty analysis of these processes. I have also developed the SRS model calibration algorithm. Currently, I am working on the development of the global AWRA model.
